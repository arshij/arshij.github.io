                    <p>I haven’t written anything in a while, and that’s because I’ve been so consumed with school and making the most of my freshman year at SCU. Spring was definitely the most challenging quarter academically, but also the most rewarding. I am happy to say I truly enjoyed my classes this quarter and was genuinely interested in the material!</p>

                    <p>Other than school, however, I developed greatly as a person as well. Some cool things you should do:</p>

                    <ol><strong>1. Try new things!</strong></ol>
                    <ul>If you know me, you know that I’m pretty reserved and not that social. As cliché as this may sound, college is truly about stepping out of your comfort zone and trying new things. So, given my nature, it’s hard to believe I would ever think about joining a fraternity. But, I decided to try something new and see what would come of it. I went to all the events during rush week, pushed myself to be more social, met some pretty cool enginerds, and surprisingly, was extended a bid. I’m extremely glad I made that decision, because I’ve made some great friends, had some really fun times, and have learned a lot of useful things because of them.</ul><br>
                    
                    <ol><strong>2. Learn how to say no</strong></ol>
                    <ul>It’s great to be a nice person, but not when you get taken advantage of. Similarly to what I rambled on in “Learning to Walk Away”, it’s important to learn when to say no to someone when you’re at risk. Stay true to your morals and be confident enough to say no and not feel guilty about it. It’s quite a powerful skill to have, and you’ll be denying yourself great experiences if you don’t have it. It’s easy to be a people pleaser, but it’s more liberating to do things for yourself instead.</ul><br>
                    
                    <ol><strong>3. Think about your future</strong></ol>
                    <ul>Every now and then, you should sit down and think about your goals and ambitions, and see if you’re working towards them. For me, as a rising sophomore, I don’t know what I want to do yet with my Computer Engineering degree, but it’s not too early to start thinking of options. I’m really interested in math and data science, so I started looking at courses I could take for a minor and internships/research positions I could obtain to explore the field more. I’m going to be learning the R programming language and using it in computational biology research this fall. Think about what you want to do 5-10 years from now, and what you can do <strong>now</strong> as a small step towards that goal. :)</ul>
