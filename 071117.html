                <div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1">
                    <p>I’ve been playing piano for the last 11 to 12 years. As a child, I was the typical Asian student; I went to class once a week, I performed beautiful pieces at the annual recitals, and I took exams and achieved the Certificate of Merit. My parents, proud of me and wanting to show off my skills, would make me play a piece or two every time we had guests over. I would even learn to play Hindi songs by ear on my own, to impress everyone even more.</p>

                    <p>Then, when I was around 13, I stopped going to classes. Since I had moved, I had a new teacher who was extremely strict and the classes were very inconsistent — sometimes I wouldn’t show, sometimes she wouldn’t. I grew older and my life started to get busier as I entered high school. My Russian instructor was old, hard to get along with, and insanely strict. She took the fun and joy out of learning, and especially the calming and relaxing effect piano had on me. Every time I played a piece for her I would be nervous, anxious as to when she would yell at me for messing up, and quite often near tears. Her and my progressively busy life led to me quitting classes.</p>

                    <p>But I didn’t stop playing. There were big breaks since I didn’t have class to force me to play and high school was extremely busy, and I can’t play sheet music nearly as well as I could before, but I have a talent. I have a talent for playing music by ear (that is, playing any song I want to without any sheet music). I can figure out the tunes in an instant and sometimes try to challenge myself with hard songs. Mostly, I play Hindi songs.</p>

                    <p>Recently, I’ve started to play more and more piano because of my free time over the summer. I try to learn beautiful Hindi songs, and some American hits too. The fun and joy, and calming and relaxing effect piano gave me has come back. I feel like my 6-year old self again, as I gracefully hit each key and lift my foot up on the pedal at the perfect moments. I smile as I play each song seamlessly without sheet music, as if the notes and tunes just come to me. Sometimes the songs I pick are advanced and harder to figure out, and I enjoy the challenge and feel extremely satisfied and accomplished when I figure it out.</p>
                    
                    <p>The best part is, I’ve even inspired my little sister to play. Every time I start playing, I stare at her face, completely struck with awe. She blurts out songs for me to play, and I figure out the tunes and play them for her. She begs me to teach her and attempts to learn on her own, like me. It’s humbling to inspire passion to people, especially younger siblings who look up to you.</p>
                    
                    <p>I implore you all to have a special talent in something. It can be anything — learn to cook, play a sport or instrument, honestly anything — but I encourage you to develop mastery in something. Do one thing better than anyone else can. Through this, not only will you develop confidence in yourself, you’ll do it while inspiring others, and have something to talk about. Set some time aside and invest in yourself — the return is worth it and highly rewarding.</p>
