                    <p>Dear 2016,</p>

                    <p>Thank you for one of the greatest years of my life. So many important things I achieved and experienced this year: I graduated high school and started college, what a huge milestone in my life! I turned 18, I won 6th place the international DECA conference, I had a summer to reflect and change my outlook on life, I made some pretty awesome life-long friends, I went to my first hackathon, I started driving, I became a research assistant and got my first job, and finally, one of my favorites: I visited my family in India after 3 years and celebrated the new year in India!!</p>

                    <p>A special thank you to my parents this year, especially for supporting me through the gruesome college application process and helping and supporting me in the decisions I made. (Made the right decision by the way, Santa Clara University is the GOAT).</p>

                    <p>My prayers are with everyone who faced a difficult time this year, be it with President-elect Trump, or tragedies all over the world, including Brussels, Orlando, Nice and Berlin. I wish that 2017 brings you more happiness, and just remember that the sun always shines after it rains, and that you need rain to make rainbow. All the best :)</p>

                    <p>I learned and accomplished so much this year, and I hope to learn from my mistakes and conquer 2017. 2 + 0 + 1 + 7 = 10, my lucky number, so hopefully this is a lucky year for me too! I gained so much insight within just the first 3 months of college, and I hope to thrive even more academically this year. All this insight and knowledge was gained by experience, something I find very important...</p>

                    <p>Experience is key. Experiencing life and learning different perspectives helps you understand life better, and ultimately helps you become a better, more knowledgable and aware person. Always remember to be appreciative and respectful of others. You never know what someone else is going through because smiles can be deceptive. I urge you all to be considerate of others and know that your words and actions have significant impacts on others. And this is all because of perspective. Before making any decision or judgment, look at all the different perspectives and ask yourself if what you are thinking is right. Understanding perspectives shows that you are mature and able to make rational judgments. So, in 2017, I ask you all to please be considerate of everyoneâ€™s lives and look at life from their shoes; it makes a huge difference.</p>

                    <p>Thank you, 2016, for making me more mature and understanding. I hope in 2017 I can reflect on my mistakes and ensure I do not make them again. I wish for more happiness for me, for you, and for the world in 2017. Enjoy and live life to the fullest!</p>
