                    <p>In the journey of life, you are inevitably going to face ups and downs, but what is most important is how you learn and grow from the negatives. If something in your life is unnecessarily toxic and not worthwhile, it may be time to walk away. I understand this may be a hard skill to gain for some people, especially if the issue requires emotional investment. It may take some time and practice, but I believe that you should learn to be strong enough to get up and walk away from something that is negatively impacting you and, more importantly, your mental health.</p>
                    
                    <p>Maslowâ€™s Hierarchy of Needs state a series of psychological, personal and social needs that affect a person's motivation and ability to achieve something. Physiological needs, safety needs, and social needs come first, in that order, which allow you to live with a peace of mind. Once you have satisfied your social needs, you have to fulfill your esteem needs. This means having self-respect, reputation, etc. to give you a sense of purpose in life. Once you have a strong sense of self-esteem, you will come to self-actualization, where you strive to be the best possible person you can be. Walking away comes into play in these last two needs, as you need self-respect and inner motivation and drive to become a better and healthier human being.</p>
                    
                    <p>Walking away can be interpreted in a multitude of ways. It can be social -- meaning you may have to stop interacting with a person or group of people, be it unfollowing them on social media or ceasing all forms of communication. Do not let people that make you unhappy take control of your life; be the bigger person and walk away. It does not matter for a second what other people think, especially if your life goals and mental health are at risk.</p>
                    
                    <p>Walking away can also be personal. It may be bad habits or negative attitudes that you bring upon yourself. <strong>Be concious of your attitude</strong> -- this is very, very important. Understanding yourself and your behavior is absolutely crucial before you can improve yourself. When faced under extreme levels of stress, first distinguish what kind of stress it is. Is it eustress -- stress that motivates you and leads to high levels of performance -- or is it distress, distracting you and negatively impacting your physical and mental health? If you are facing distress, it may be a good indication that you need to walk away from something. Analyze your behavior and your attitude. Is this attitude working against you or for you? Why do you hold this attitude? What can you do to change this attitude for the better?</p>
                    
                    <p>In order to walk away, it is also important that you build on your self-esteem as stated in Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Self-efficacy deals with your sense of competence, and self-respect deals with your sense of personal worth. It is necessary to have both, as Raymond B. Landis, Dean of Engineering at UCLA, states "if you feel competent but not worthy, you may accomplish a great deal, but you will not enjoy it". Be strong and know your worth; you have the potential to be a unique and extraordinary person -- don't let anyone tell you otherwise! Work hard, play hard, and live life to the fullest. :) </p>
