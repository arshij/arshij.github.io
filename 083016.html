                    <p>Going to one of the most competitive high schools in California was definitely difficult. I was immature, I complained about the problems instead of finding solutions, and I was pessimistic. Four years ago, I was a completely different person. It wasn't till the summer of 2016 that I truly understood myself, who I wanted to become, and how to become that person. I realized the mistakes I made in the past, the good and bad connections I made along the way, and I got a chance to change my perspective on... well, everything.</p>

                    <p>I recently finished reading an amazing book, Deep Work, by Cal Newport (a truly remarkable individual). After reading his take on "focused success in a distracted world", I realized how much time I've wasted in high school. I feel guilty, and I know many others who do, too.</p>

                    <p>To summarize, Newport breaks this book into two sections - why deep work is important, and how to achieve deep work. His rules for success are: work deeply, embrace boredom, quit social media, and drain the shallows. I highly recommend this book to anyone who wants an honest, straight-forward and life-changing read.</p>

                    <p>I am now learning to alter my study habits. In high school, I spent hours memorizing facts that were forgotten the day after the test was taken (ultimately forcing me to cram the same information again for finals). I spent hours doing busy work for classes I was not interested in with unreasonable teachers. I did not sleep; the past two years of my life, I have been surviving on 2 to 4 hours of a sleep a night to often not sleeping at all. The load became so much that I quit playing for my high school tennis team my senior year, after committing to the sport for twelve years. I procrastinated, I was always struggling to catch up, and I was unhealthy. I constantly told myself I needed to change my lifestyle, but I just never got the chance to stop and breathe.</p>

                    <p>Going to a high school where you are forced to perform higher than insanely competitive students who came from the same socioeconomic background as you was tough. I was burned out. I changed as a person; I don't know who I became. I desperately attempted to catch up on sleep whenever I could, and I'll admit - sometimes it was during class. I constantly told myself "pain is temporary, GPA is forever" and performed each task assigned to me solely because if I didn't I'd be behind. I understand a lot of students can relate to every aspect of this, and will blame it on their high school. That's what I did. I blamed my teachers, I blamed my peers, I blamed everyone but myself. And that was the wrong mindset. I was to blame the entire time.</p>

                    <p>I did not stop and think about what I was doing. I just kept going, not questioning anything or anyone, in fear of staying left behind. And that's where I went wrong. I should have stopped. I should have noticed something was wrong. But I won't dwell on the past. I finally had this summer of freedom, not worrying about SATs and ACTs or going to some life-changing summer program that I can write my college application essays about. And in this summer of freedom, I realized so many things. </p>
                    
                    <ol>    1. SLEEP </ol>
                    <ul>     I never truly understood the powerful impact of staying well-rested. You wake up with a glow on your face (instead of dark circles and eye bags like I have been for the past two years), you feel happy and confident, you are healthy, and you perform significantly better on all your tasks.</ul><br>
                    
                    <ol>    2. GENUINE FRIENDSHIPS AND CONNECTIONS </ol>
                    <ul>     I got around to realize who I'm investing my time and effort in. I understood who was truly my friend, who I could go to in times of despair, who would show up for me when I needed them. I then proceeded to filter outÂ all of those individuals I met that have caused me to be negative, and I continued to converse with those who brought out the best in me. No more negativity and pessimism in my life.</ul><br>
                        
                    <ol>    3. FUTURE CAREER PLANS </ol>
                    <ul>     It's never too early to start thinking about your future. I have decided to pursue an M.B.A. and/or M.S. in computer science after I graduate. I have created a plan expressing my academic and career-building aspirations. I have set high goals for myself, because as my favorite character Harvey Specter says, "I don't have dreams, I have goals". I've realized it's okay to dream big; failure is a part of life.</ul>
                      
<p>I can go on and on with this list, but these three things are what I've thought of most this summer. I am beyond overjoyed to be heading to college with such a powerful and strong mindset. I am excited to go to classes that I am genuinely interested in, with no more busy work to put something in the grade-book, and with professors that truly care about the subject they are teaching. I am passionate about my studies, and I am proud to say I have matured a great deal from the girl I was four years ago. I am ready for whatever college throws at me, which I only have Dougherty Valley High to thank, for transforming me into an aggressive, determined and confident young woman. My new perspective on life will carry me to achieving my goals. </p>
