                    <p>My university gave me the wonderful opportunity to attend the Grace Hopper Conference in Orlando, Florida this year - the world’s largest computing conference for women in tech. I, alongside 18,000 other amazing women in tech, learned an overwhelming amount and had a fabulous week of women supporting women in tech. There were keynotes hosted everyday, with inspiring female leaders such as Melinda Gates. There were numerous workshops hosted from women engineers in industry, with topics ranging from career advice to breakthroughs in specialized subjects within computing. Also featured at GHC is one of the largest career fairs for women, with hundreds of companies eager to recruit students.</p>

                    <p>I’m sure you’ve heard of the current gender gap problem in tech. The problem is that computer science is a male-dominated field - most famous business professionals are male, and women pioneers go unnoticed. Surprisingly enough, until 1984, most programmers were women! What happened in 1984 that made women stop coding?</p>

                    <p>To explain what happened, we can first take a glance at a case study. A brilliant female student named Patty Ordonez was a math champion and highly interested in computer science. Lee Van Dorn was a male coding genius, who happened to own a computer at home. The problem was that in 1984, you could not succeed in a computer science course without a computer. After struggling through her CS courses, Patty lost her self-confidence and switched her major.</p>

                    <p>I know what you’re thinking. That’s easy - just give all the students a computer and problem solved! But in 1984, since all boys wanted a computer, advertisements were targeted towards males only. Computers had games, which were regarded as toys, and marketed towards boys. Gradually, all media, books, news, articles discouraged women from pursuing CS and presented CS as an only-male thing. The majority of women majoring in CS got consumed by the culture of not being good enough and dropped out.</p>
                    
                    <p>Nowadays, there is clear awareness of the gender gap problem present in society. We need more female engineers! In fact, early voice recognition softwares failed because they could not recognize female voices, since mostly males programmed those softwares. I am so proud to be a female engineer, and I truly believe we have what it takes to transform and take the engineering world even further. I commend organizations like Girls Who Code, SWE, and ACM-W that are dedicated towards inspiring and encouraging more girls to partake in STEM fields. I am forever thankful for events like Grace Hopper that seek to motivate female engineers and provide us with resources to unlock our full potential.</p>
