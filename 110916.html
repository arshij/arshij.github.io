                    <p>November 8, 2016. What a historic day – one that will be written in the textbooks. On November 8, the truth of America was revealed. It’s frightening to see that the majority of the country will accept a misogynistic, racist, xenophobic and unexperienced man to run this great country, if it means that they will be paying fewer taxes. It is unfortunate to see that people voted for him solely because he was the Republican candidate. It is unfortunate to see that some people felt as if there was no other choice simply because they could not afford it. It is heartbreaking to see children crying of fear all across the nation.</p>

                    <p>In my eyes, the image I see when I see Trump does not reflect my vision for America. This country and it’s leadership is not solely about making America superior. It’s not why my parents and I struggled and overcame hardship over hardship as immigrants to this country. America symbolized hope, change, opportunity and so much more. It allowed people of any race, gender or sexual orientation to be able to pursue their dreams. And to me, Hillary symbolized this. Sure, everyone has flaws. Sure, this election was about picking the “lesser of two evils” for some. But when you put the two candidates side by side, one represents progression, change, and the continution of Obama’s platform, and the other represents the reality of America. The reality is, the silent majority in America turn a blind eye to critical issues like diversity and climate change, issues that President Obama worked so hard to bring positive impact to. The reality is, the silent majority in America don’t care about social impact and making America not just financially stable but also as a country that makes you feel proud to live in, a role model country.</p>

                    <p>And last night, the silent majority won. But that’s okay. We’ve been winning for the past 8 years. And this is just a minor setback. I personally am someone who enjoys challenges and will not stop fighting until I’ve won. So think of this as a test, a challenge. This election is testing our ability to stay united as a country, because we ARE stronger together. We cannot let this division and hatred break apart the wonderful country that previous leaders have poured their life into.</p>

                    <p>And if you’re still not satisfied, I know how you feel. We had the chance to make history again after electing the first African-American president to electing the first female president. But instead, we took one step forward, two steps backwards. We need to unite in order to move forward in the future. We need to listen to one another, we need to be more accepting of each other’s cultures, we need to accept that America is not a country that should be boasting white supremacy anymore, but should instead embrace the fact that it is the only country that is so diverse. I am disappointed in America’s decision yesterday, but I am positive that we can take this as a learning experience, spread education and awareness, and fight back harder in 4 years. Almost all my faith instilled in this country was crushed after yesterday’s results, but I still have some unwavering hope that America is one of the greatest countries in the world, and will make the right decision next time.</p>
