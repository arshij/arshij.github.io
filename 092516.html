                    <p>College is a time to work hard, make life-long friendships and memories, and it essentially serves as a platform to jumpstart your career. The following are some great things I learned in my first week:</p>
                    
                    <ol>    1. DON’T LET YOUR SUMMER GO TO WASTE </ol>
                    <ul>    Most people spend the summer before college partying, going on vacation, Netflixing, and living it up with their best buds before leaving for college, which is all fine, but I advise you to think about your future as well. High school, especially second semester senior year, is very different from college for most people. If you memorized your way through high school without actually learning anything, college is going to be hell week from the start for you. Spend the summer revising concepts (be it in math, programming, economics, science, etc.), reading books to ensure you maintain the ability to focus, and trying to keep good sleeping and eating habits for the majority of your summer (it’s okay to enjoy late nights making s’mores with your friends sometimes, but keep a limit!). Trust me, this helps. I started putting this into action from the middle of my summer, after I got tired of being bored and binge-watching shows. And just the first day of class, I slept before midnight, completed all my work while making an effort to thoroughly understand the topics taught, impressed my teachers, enjoyed time with new friends, and felt fresh and confident the next morning to do it all over again.</ul><br>
                    
                    <ol>    2. SIT FRONT ROW </ol>
                    <ul>    This isn’t too bad of a problem if you go to a small private college like me. I arrived to each class 10 minutes early and picked any spot I wanted at the front. This way, I could answer any question the professor asked of me, pay attention and focus better, and make a solid impression on my professor. And generally speaking, those who sit in the front row have a similar mindset. So now you can make friends and form study groups with other driven students like you, and you’ll know just where to find them! Make a smart and memorable first impression on your peers and professors. Ask yourself what kind of student you want to be.</ul><br>
                        
                    <ol>    3. GET INVOLVED </ol>
                    <ul>    In high school, you might have been forced to join clubs and extra-curriculars just so you can appear to be a well-rounded student and have something to write in college applications. Whether that be the case for you or not, college is a time where you can join student organizations for the sole purpose of benefitting you, helping your career, making new friends, and/or pursuing a passion in something you are genuinely interested in -- how great is that! You can join honor societies, a large variety of clubs ranging from multicultural to sports to major-specific to just about any hobby, gain research assistant positions, internships, or get an on-campus job! Put down your books and see what amazing opportunities your campus has to offer. Try new things, pursue your passion, and make time for yourself and your happiness.</ul><br>
                    
                    <ol>    4. GO TO OFFICE HOURS </ol>
                    <ul>    Office hours are for smart students, not for dumb ones. The students who seize this opportunity (especially if going to a larger public school) are the ones who race ahead. Professors are professors because they want to help you understand and spread their precious knowledge to you. Undoubtedly, college is hard, and especially when you have to adjust to your courses, a new lifestyle, not being spoon-fed like you were in high school, it can get really overwhelming. By attending office hours, you will be able to easily transition into the fast-paced culture, clear up any confusions about the hard topics that are taught in a blink of an eye, and also show your professor that you care about what you are learning, you appreciate and respect them, and you want to gain as much knowledge as you can (after all, college is extremely expensive; don’t put your/your parents' money to waste!). So even if you have one question, make the effort to put down the ping-pong paddle and go to office hours and ask it. Who knows? You could learn so much more.</ul>
                      
<p>I am extremely satisfied with the kind of student I am turning out to be. Being an engineering major is very tough, but I am enjoying my experience so far. I have peers who are in the same boat as me, wonderful professors who are willing to devote so much time and effort to help us understand better, an extremely great campus with endless opportunities to prepare me for my career, and a strong mindset that will ensure I do not ever give up. I’ve learned to enjoy my college experience without jeopardizing my career in the process, all through time management, strong planning, and by keeping a positive and determined attitude. You can have it all.</p>
