                    <p>Dear 2017,</p>

                    <p>Thank you for a wonderful year of self-growth and learning. Through the ups and downs of my personal and professional life, I am grateful to have not only recovered from every failure, but also to have learned and grown from those experiences. I accomplished a lot this year: successfully completed my first year of college and started my second, joined a professional engineering fraternity, visited family in India once again, travelled to Europe for the first time and visited London, Paris, and Switzerland, attended GHC 2017 in Orlando, took on a second research job regarding machine learning, and finally completed the Physics series in my coursework! In addition, I am really proud of my personal growth - I spent much time maturing, growing, and understanding myself better.</p>

                    <p>Rather than having resolutions, here are a few goals of mine I want to continue to pursue in 2018:</p>

                    <ol><strong>1. Self-care</strong></ol>
                    <ul>The last two years of highschool really took a toll on my mental and physical health. I was so caught up with academics that I did not take care of my health. I went into my first year of college with the same determined mindset to achieve greatness in my career, but also continued to neglect my health. Despite an extremely difficult workload in 2018, I promise to make my physical and mental health a priority. I will maintain a healthy sleep schedule, eat healthier, exercise and resume playing sports, and ensure I make time to relieve stress.</ul><br>
                    
                    <ol><strong>2. Self-confidence</strong></ol>
                    <ul>This year, I want to improve my self-esteem and confidence. Sometimes I suffer with anxiety and lack of confidence before challenging events, which usually results in poor performance. I’ve realized how important it is that YOU believe in yourself, whether or not other people do too. It holds you back from taking risks, exploring new things, and stepping out of your comfort zone. So this year, I promise to work on my self-confidence to become a more successful and happier person.</ul><br>
                    
                    <ol><strong>3. Explore engineering outside of school</strong></ol>
                    <ul>I’ve come to realize that the engineering courses we take at university, although quite difficult, are extremely basic and serve as foundational purposes. In fact, they’re pretty useless in industry unless you learn how to apply that knowledge to your job. This year, I wish to explore my major outside of academics. Through internships, side projects, or learning new languages/frameworks while building something, I hope to gain valuable experience and technical skills that will prepare me for the workforce.</ul>
                    
                    <p>Make the most of this “fresh start”. Be ambitious, set high goals for yourself, continue working on yourself, and watch yourself grow into an incredible and successful individual. But remember: don’t bite more than you can chew. Write a few goals down like I did above and constantly remind yourself of them. I’m focusing on self-growth and finding my passion this year. What about you?</p>

                    <p>Cheers to 2018!</p>
