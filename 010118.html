                    <p>Dear 2017,</p>

                    <p>Thank you for a wonderful year of self-growth and learning. Through the ups and downs of my personal and professional life, I am grateful to have not only recovered from every failure, but also to have learned and grown from those experiences. I accomplished a lot this year: successfully completed my first year of college and started my second, joined a professional engineering fraternity, visited family in India once again, travelled to Europe for the first time and visited London, Paris, and Switzerland, attended GHC 2017 in Orlando, took on a second research job regarding machine learning, and finally completed the Physics series in my coursework! In addition, I am really proud of my personal growth - I spent much time maturing, growing, and understanding myself better.</p>

                    <p>Rather than having resolutions, here is one of the many goals of mine I want to continue to pursue in 2018:</p>
                    
                    <strong>I really want to explore engineering outside of school.</strong>
                    <p>I’ve come to realize that the engineering courses we take at university, although quite difficult, are extremely basic and serve as foundational purposes. In fact, they’re pretty useless in industry unless you learn how to apply that knowledge to your job. This year, I wish to explore my major outside of academics. Through internships, side projects, or learning new languages/frameworks while building something, I hope to gain valuable experience and technical skills that will prepare me for the workforce.</p>
                    
                    <p>Make the most of this “fresh start”. Be ambitious, set high goals for yourself, continue working on yourself, and watch yourself grow into an incredible and successful individual. But remember: don’t bite more than you can chew. Write a few goals down like I did above and constantly remind yourself of them. I’m focusing on self-growth and finding my passion this year. What about you?</p>

                    <p>Cheers to 2018!</p>
