									<h2 class="major">What is Solemate?</h2>
									<p>Solemate is a mobile application designed to enhance the running experience through music. Our feed-forward algorithm sets the runner's pace by playing music that varies in tempo. By encouraging the user to match their steps to the beat, our application cultivates a run that feels natural and inspires intrinsic motivation, especially for the beginner runner.</p>

									<h2 class="major">Technologies</h2>
									<p>Technologies used to build this app were <strong>React Native</strong>, <strong>Firebase</strong> and <strong>Apple CoreMotion</strong>. React Native is the client-side scripting language to render the application, Firebase is the database management system to store data, and Apple CoreMotion is the built-in iPhone framework to retrieve the user's step data.</p>

                                    <h2 class="major">How it works</h2>
                                    <p style="font-size:15px;">Users can build their profile based on their running experience level for a well-structured training program. By matching the pace of their running with the song's beat, a runner can experience a more fulfilling run. Based on the length of the run, songs will vary in beats per minute (BPM) alerting the runner when to walk or run. The user is encouraged to match their step to the beat of the song. For a beginner, this might be demonstrated through songs with slower BPM for a shorter total time in comparison to an intermediate runner. Progress will be monitored and presented in the form of data visualization, allowing the user to see how far along they are in the training process.</p>
